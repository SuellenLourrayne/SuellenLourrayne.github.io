# Suellen Lourrayne - My Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio! This is a simple and clean website I built to showcase who I am and projects I’ve successfully created.

## About

Here you’ll find a little bit about me, along with my profile photo and screenshots of my projects.

The site uses soft, earthy colors with smooth fade-in animations as you scroll down, for a calm and inviting feel.

## Projects

I’m highlighting two projects here:

- **JS Cleaning Service** — a one page website for a cleaning company.
- **Register Your Car – Bonnington Hotel** — a web form for guests to register their vehicles.

Each project has a brief description and live links.

## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3 (external stylesheet)
- JavaScript for scroll-triggered animations

## Contact Me
